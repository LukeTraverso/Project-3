# Project-3
This project uses the Yelp Fusion API to fetch business reviews, clean and analyze the text data, and visualize the results. In this project, I specifically wanted to get insights into the people's sentiments towards Randolph piza vendors. 
- What is the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of customers for pizza businesses in Randolph, NJ?
- What are the most common words used in customer reviews, and what insights do they provide?

The file that runs everything is named, 'YelpReviewAnalysis'
